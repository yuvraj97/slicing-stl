See the simulation at:    
 https://mesh-sim-97.herokuapp.com/    

`STL-sim.py` contains all the logic used for slicing stl file.   
For better understanding you can use `STL-sim.ipynb` (a `jupyter notebook`)

## Installation
Python 3.x is needed to be installed on your system.  
Install all libraries needed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

Now you can use the `STL-sim.py` and `STL-sim.ipynb`

(also note that the `default.stl` needed to be 
rotated clockwise along the `+ x axis` to correct its orientation)
